## 🔧 Day Codes

Day codes are loaded dynamically from the selected zone workbook.

| Code | Example Name | Typical Pattern |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| A | Lodge 4PM | Lodge-focused quieter day |
| B | Lodge 5PM | Lodge + schools pattern |
| E | Explorer 5PM | Explorer-focused day |
| I | Explorer + 7PM | Higher-demand Explorer day |
| K | WT Off-Peak | Short/quiet operating day |

Final staffing requirements can differ per zone and per selected unit set.

## 🧠 Staffing And Break Logic (Current)

This section describes the current assignment and break behavior used by the scheduler.

### Staffing model

1. Assignment is multi-pass, not single-pass.
2. Skill-gated retail units are protected first (especially Sealife and Sweet Shop), then wider host placement continues.
3. Entrances can be intentionally overstaffed in the morning, then rebalanced into retail in the afternoon.
4. Day code and open entrances drive target behavior; targets are dynamic, not a fixed global table.

### Dynamic overflow targets

Overflow targets vary based on which entrances are open for that day code.

1. Explorer + Schools open:
Explorer 4, Lodge 3, Schools 2, APGS 2, Sweet 2, Sealife 1, Supplies 1, B&J 2, B&J Kiosk 1, Lorikeets 1
2. Explorer only:
Explorer 4, Lodge 2, APGS 2, Sweet 2, Sealife 1, Supplies 1, B&J 2, B&J Kiosk 1, Lorikeets 1
3. Schools only:
Lodge 4, Schools 2, APGS 2, Sweet 2, Sealife 1, Supplies 1, B&J 2, B&J Kiosk 1, Lorikeets 1
4. Lodge-only quiet days:
Lodge 1, APGS 2, Sweet 2, Sealife 1, Lorikeets 1

Notes:

1. Azteca is treated as morning-only pre-pass support and is not part of normal overflow targeting.
2. APGS minimum fill is guarded so it does not steal hosts when Sweet Shop or Sealife have zero coverage.

### Afternoon rebalance

After lunch breaks, entrance overflow is moved to retail while preserving entrance minimums.

1. Explorer baseline days keep higher Explorer coverage.
2. Schools baseline days keep higher Schools/Lodge coverage.
3. Lodge-only days keep lower minimum entrance coverage.
4. Retail destination priority favors B&J when understaffed, then Sweet Shop, APGS, Sealife, Supplies, and other retail.

### Break slot logic

Core non-rides slots:

1. 11:00
2. 12:00
3. 13:00
4. 14:00
5. 15:00

Preferred break timing by shift pattern:

1. Early closers (home by 15:00): earliest break preference (11:00)
2. Senior Hosts: 12:00 or later (never 11:00)
3. Early starters (before 09:00): 11:00 preference
4. Mid starters (09:00 to 10:45): 12:00 preference, with cascade
5. Late starters (11:00+): 14:00 preference, cascade to 15:00 if needed

### 2-person unit staggering

Two-person units are handled with dedicated stagger logic to avoid simultaneous breaks.

1. If one person is already breaking in a slot, the second is pushed to the next safe slot.
2. This is specifically designed to avoid both people in units like Sealife and Explorer Supplies breaking together.

### Practical implications

1. You may see high entrance staffing early in day.
2. Reassignment to retail is expected after lunch windows.
3. If trained staff are unavailable for a skill-gated unit, controlled fallback can be used for continuity (except strict B&J skill rules).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Reinstall dependencies
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend won't start

```bash
# Check npm version
npm --version  # Should be 9+

# Reinstall dependencies
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```

### Excel generation fails

```bash
# Check ExcelJS is installed
cd backend
npm list exceljs

# Reinstall if needed
npm install exceljs --save
```

### Day codes not showing

- Check backend console for errors
- Verify dayCodeRequirements.js exists in backend/data/
- Restart backend server

---

## 📝 Development

### Adding a New Day Code

Edit `backend/data/dayCodeRequirements.js`:

```javascript
'P': {
  name: 'New Day Code',
  description: 'Description here',
  positions: [
    {
      unit: 'Croc Drop',
      position: 'OP',
      staffCount: 1,
      startTime: '09:15',
      endTime: '16:45',
      breakMinutes: 45
    },
    // ... more positions
  ]
}
```

### Modifying UI Colors

Edit `frontend/src/components/SchedulerWorkflow.css`:

```css
/* Primary gradient */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Change to your colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR 0%, #YOUR_COLOR 100%);
```
